    "## Perceptually uniform continuous colormaps from CET\n",
    "\n",
    "Peter Kovesi at the Center for Exploration Targeting created a very useful set of [perceptually uniform continuous colormaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03700), many of which can replace the highly non-uniform colormaps provided with Python plotting programs.  Here we will show how to use them via a Python package named [colorcet](https://github.com/pyviz/colorcet), listing all the ones available and allowing you to evaluate how perceptually uniform they are for you, your particular monitor, etc. Download and installation instructions are at the [github site](https://github.com/pyviz/colorcet).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will plot them using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) via [Holoviews](http://holoviews.org), but identical [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) palettes are also provided, and both Bokeh palettes and Matplotlib colormaps are usable in [Datashader](https://github.com/pyviz/datashader).  Thus these colormaps can be used in any of those Python packages, as well as any other package that accepts a Python list of normalized RGB tuples or hex colors.  See \n",

The matplotlib maintainers use different definitions of perceptually uniform (uniformity in a different color space), but the new matplotlib perceptually uniform colormaps do well at Peter's test image:"
